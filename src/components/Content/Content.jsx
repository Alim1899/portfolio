      I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, high-performance
      user interfaces that seamlessly blend design and functionality. My focus
      is on building pixel-perfect, responsive websites that help local
      businesses establish a strong online presence. Currently, I specialize in
      creating and optimizing websites for local companies, ensuring they are
      not only visually appealing but also fast, user-friendly, and
      SEO-optimized. From intuitive navigation to clean, maintainable code, I
      prioritize both aesthetics and engineering excellence to deliver effective
      digital experiences. Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects,
      from e-commerce platforms and business landing pages to custom web
      applications. My expertise in React, Tailwind CSS, and modern web
      technologies allows me to build scalable and maintainable solutions
      tailored to each client's needs. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find
      me exploring hiking trails, diving into automotive research, or refining
      my latest React project.
